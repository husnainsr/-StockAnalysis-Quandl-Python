# Stock Data Analysis with Quandl API and Python

This project uses the Quandl API and Python to perform stock data analysis for HBL, ABL, UBL, and BOP from 2011 to 2021. The project includes subplots to visualize the total turnover of stock being traded each day, daily price changes, monthly and yearly means of close price, and daily returns.

The project also identifies the dates each bank stock had the best and worst single day returns and determines the riskiest bank stock over the entire time period using standard deviation, and presents the results in a bar chart. Additionally, a line plot showing the Close price for each bank for the entire time in a single graph is included.

Furthermore, the project provides three additional interesting visualizations and findings presented in markdown.

### Questions Answered:

-   Visualize the total turnover of stock being traded each day for all companies using subplots.
-   Visualize the daily price change in stock using (open price â€“ previous close price).
-   Plot the monthly and yearly mean of close price.
-   Plot the daily returns using (previous close/close)-1.
-   Identify the dates each bank stock had the best and worst single day returns.
-   Determine the riskiest bank stock over the entire time period using standard deviation and present the results in a bar chart.
-   Line plot showing the Close price for each bank for the entire time in a single graph.
-   Three additional interesting visualizations and findings presented in markdown.

### Tools and Libraries:

-   Python
-   Quandl API
-   NumPy
